This project is a Streamlit‑based AI tool that generates personalized cold emails from any job posting URL. It scrapes the job description from the web page, cleans the text, uses a Groq‑hosted Llama 3.3 model (via LangChain) to extract structured job details, and then composes a tailored outreach email. A ChromaDB‑backed portfolio store is queried by required skills so the model can automatically insert the most relevant project links into each email
